 The term "skill" in language teaching : one of the four modes of language:
speaking, listening, reading, or writing
 In skill-based syllabus, the term is used to designate a specific way of
defining the content of language teaching.
 Skill defined as specific way of using language that combines structural and
functional ability but exists independently of specific settings, or situations.
 Examples:
 Reading skills such as skimming and scanning
 writing skills such as writing specific topic sentences and certain kinds of
discourse (e.g., memos, research reports, work reports)

--- page 3 ---
 Competencies are similar to behavioral objectives in that they
competenc
define what a learner is able to do as a result of instruction.
 Not all native speakers of a language are equally competent users
y-based 
of language. Also, individuals have varying competence in the
different skill areas.

 Some are more "skilled" readers than others. At the same time, one
person may be a particularly skilled reader but perform extremely
poorly when required to carry on an emergency conversation on a
mobile radio.
 The ability to use language in specific ways (settings and registers) is
partially dependent on general language ability, but partly based on
experience and the need for specific skills.
 Language skills may, in fact, be limited to specific settings.

 Learners with limited overall ability in a second language learn to perform
specific limited tasks, but cannot always generalize to other applications of
the skills in the language.
 Complexity and predictability of the task
 To the degree that situations of language use and the needs of learners can
be defined and matched, it is sometimes possible to teach or emphasize
specific types of language use and to teach toward them.
 Language for specific purposes (LSP)

 Skill-based instructional content : reductionist theory of language
 It views the overall language system as reducible, at least for teaching
purposes, to specific skills or applications
 Specific skills can be grafted onto limited general ability
 Language as it is used in some specific ways is formulaic and predictable
 Another approach to skill-based instruction addresses general or overall
language ability through specific skill instruction
 In this approach, instruction in specific skills is provided in addition to
instruction designed to develop global language ability. The skills are
presented broadly and with varied and variable applications (e.g., intensive
reading of many different types of texts), so that specific skills and global
ability are developed simultaneously.

 Skill-based instruction is not associated with any specific theory of
learning. The general theory is that the learning of complex behaviors
such as language is best facilitated by breaking them down into small
bits (skills), teaching the bits, and hoping that the learner will be able to
put them together when actually using them.

 Guessing vocabulary from context
 Scanning of nonprose material
 Reading for the main idea
 lnferencing
Examples of 
 More scanning of nonprose material
Skill-Based 
 Summarizing readings
Syllabi
 More work on affixes
 Dictionary work
 Restatement of informational content
 More inference work
 More restatement

 Useful when learners need to master specific types of
language uses, either exclusively or as part of broader
competency.
Positive 
 Efficiency and relevance of instruction
Characteristics 
 Relevance to students ’ felt needs or wants is an
of Skill-Based 
advantage of the skill-based syllabus because learners
Syllabi
who know what they need to do with the language
generally show great acceptance of instruction that is
clearly directed toward their goals.

 The degree to which ability to perform specific tasks in a language is
dependent on or independent of overall language proficiency.
Negative 
 Limited and predictable skills → skill instruction is unarguably effective
 Unpredictability in the language → a greater degree of general
Characteristics 
proficiency will be required.
of Skill-Based 
 Social and philosophical questions : competency-based instruction that
is too limited in scope can program students for particular kinds of
Syllabi
behavior (e.g., obedience in a work setting). Or isolate them from
achievements and ambitions that the competencies do not prepare
them for (e.g. education rather than entry-level employment).

 Specific, well-defined skills; little need for global language ability
 Life skills and vocationally oriented language programs for adult
immigrants and refugees
 Language programs preparing students for academic work
 Skill-based instruction is probably more appropriate for adults than for
children
Applications
 Children: a combination of skills and content
 Skill-based instruction is not appropriate, in large amounts, at least, for
general purpose or beginning-level language programs in which the needs
of the learners are broad or yet to be defined in such cases, focusing on
narrow skill-based applications will take instructional time away from
content that is more likely to address their need for overall language
proficiency.
